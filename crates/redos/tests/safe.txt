base example
	abc
lets try out groups
	(abc|def)|[nhi]?
tiny repeating string
	a{1,10}
bigger repeated string that's just right
	a{}
nested group
	(((a)))
try putting some quantifiers outside
	((a+)+)+
are optionals detected?
	(a?)+
lets try lookarounds
	(?<=a)
	(?<!a)
	(?!a)
	(?=a)
	(?>a)
	(?>a+)
can we decompose alternations?
	(a+)|(b+)|(((a)))
how about alternations in lookarounds?
	(?<=a|b)
	(?<!a|b)
	(?!a|b)
	(?=a|b)
	(?>a|b)
	(?>a+|b+)
